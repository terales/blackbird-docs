AEM (Adobe Experience Manager) is a Content Management System (CMS) that allows users and companies to easily build websites, apps, and manage web pages and content. AEM is used by developers and marketers to organize and distribute content across digital channels.

## Before setting up

Before you connect to AEM, you need to have the following:

- AEM instance running and accessible from the Blackbird platform.
- You have a technical account and created a private key for it so you can obtain a certificate to connect to AEM. Below in the `Steps to create technical account` section, you can find the steps to create a technical account and a private key and how to obtain a certificate.
- You know your base URL for AEM environment. The base URL is the URL of your AEM instance, e.g. `https://author-xxxx-xxxxx.adobeaemcloud.com`.

## Steps to create technical account and get a certificate

1. Open [Cloud Manager](https://experience.adobe.com/cloud-manager/landing.html).
2. Select needed program.

## Actions

- **Search content**: Search for content based on provided criteria.
- **Download content**: Download content as HTML. Requires a content ID.
- **Upload content**: Upload content from HTML. Requires a HTML file and target path as input.

## Events

- **On content created or updated**: Polling event that periodically checks for new or updated content. If the any content are found, the event is triggered.

## Example 

Here's an example of how to set up a translation workflow with `AEM` and `DeepL` apps that will automatically translate content in AEM and send it to DeepL for translation.

![AEM example](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bb-io/AdobeExperienceManager/main/docs/images/aem_example.png)

Here's a notes on how the example works:
- The `On content created or updated` event is triggered every hour and checks for new or updated content in AEM. If any content is found, the event is triggered.
- In the loop, the `Download content` action downloads the content from AEM in HTML format.
- The `Translate document` action of `DeepL` app sends the downloaded content to DeepL for translation. 
- The `Replace using Regex` action of `Blackbird Utilities` app replaces the original path to the target one in the translated content.

![Utilitiy example](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bb-io/AdobeExperienceManager/main/docs/images/utility_example.png)

- The `Upload content` action uploads the translated content back to AEM.
